## Overview
This project is an emotion detection-based music player. It analyzes a user's facial expression and mood, then plays music that matches the detected emotion.

## Features
- **Facial Emotion Detection**: Uses a camera to capture facial expressions and detect emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
- **Music Recommendation**: Plays songs based on the detected mood.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Continuously monitors the user's emotions for real-time music adjustments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use with a simple, intuitive interface.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `OpenCV` for facial detection
  - `DeepFace` for emotion detection
  - `Pygame` for playing music
